# The Future Home of the Ploopy Thumb Keyboard*

![The Ploopy Thumb Keyboard](thumb-keyboard.jpg)

This is the future home of the Ploopy Thumb Keyboard, a split ergonomic mechanical keyboard with an integrated trackball.

If you've got a printer and some free time, it'd be great if you grabbed a copy of the *shape-test.stl* file, printed it out, and gave it a spin. And, drop us some feedback, at **contact (at) ploopy [dot] co**.


**Still working on a name. Might change later.*
